This is an online version of the Blackjack cards game.
For those who don't really know how to play this game, here are some general rules to give you an idea about what's going on:
"Blackjack hands are scored by their point total. 
The hand with the highest total wins as long as it doesn't exceed 21;
A hand with a higher total than 21 is said to bust. 
Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, and face cards (jack, queen, king) are also worth 10."
Additionally, the code is pretty self-explanatory.
